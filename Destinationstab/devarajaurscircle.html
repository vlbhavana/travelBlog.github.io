        <p id="intro" style="margin:10">Devaraja Urs Road or Devaraj Urs Road ( officially, D Devaraj Urs Road , named after the erstwhile reformist chief minister of the state) is a road passes through the main commercial area of Mysore city.

            This road stands in the middle of a an old locality called Devaraja Mohalla. This used to be a residential area with a weekly market at a corner. That weekly market is now the Devaraja Market. The road that passed through the middle of  Devaraja Mohalla is expanded into Devaraj Urs Road with many modern shops and buildings attached on either side, replacing the erstwhile terracotta roofed houses. You can still see some of those old houses on the lanes behind the building on either sides of Devaraj Urs Road. Now this is a busy commercial street of Mysore.
            For a visitor to the city, it's about a km long stroll without any particular intension of shopping.

            <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the evenings you can see many casual walkers on Devaraj Urs Road , a good number of tourists who are keen to explore the city's life, on this road doing the so called people watching. 
            Shops on Devaraj Urs road generally close by 9 in the night, some even a bit earlier. However during the festival seasons business typically stretches till say 10 in the night. In any case Mysore doesn't have a nightlife that stretches too late into the night.
