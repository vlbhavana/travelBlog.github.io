        <p id="intro" style="margin:10">Mysore Dasara is Dussehra with a difference! The city's royal heritage ensures that the festival is elaborately celebrated on a grand scale. In Mysore, Dussehra honors the Goddess Chamundeswari (another name for Goddess Durga) of Chamundi Hill, who killed the powerful demon Mahishasur.
            Mysore Palace is dazzlingly illuminated by almost 100,000 light bulbs, nightly from 7 p.m. until 10 p.m., during the festival. In addition, the palace's magnificent Golden Throne is taken out of storage and assembled in the Durbar Hall for public viewing. This is the only time it can be seen throughout the year.

The main event takes place on the last day of the festival. A traditional procession (known as Jumboo Savari) winds its way through the streets of Mysore, starting from Mysore Palace and ending in Bannimantap. It features an idol of the Goddess Chamundeshwari, which is worshiped privately by the royal family beforehand, carried atop a lavishly decorated elephant.
Colorful floats and cultural troupes accompany it.

           <br/> In the evening, from 7 p.m., there's a Torch-Light Parade at the Bannimantap grounds on the outskirts of the city. Highlights include fireworks, daredevil stunts on motorcycles, and a laser show.

Other popular attractions include Yuva Dasara (an event targeted at the youth), food festival, cultural programs at various venues, sound and light show, sporting events (such as wrestling), a shopping festival, a flower show, vintage car rally, kite festival, and film festival.
