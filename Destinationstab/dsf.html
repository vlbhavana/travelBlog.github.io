        <p id="intro" style="margin:10">The Dubai Shopping Festival is the largest shopping and entertainment extravaganza in the Middle East.
        The month-long festival that is held around the months of November-February, with its unbeatable deals is a true blend of festivity and lights, shopping and glamour, sports and adventure, multi-cuisine food and cosmopolitan culture. The festival is much loved by travellers, as the city is decorated with lights during the season.
         There are various promotions and offers at every mall to draw buyers, with DSF turning the city into a shoppersâ€™ paradise. 
         There are entertainment shows for children and families, Kids Disneyland, Art lovers horizon and food fiesta for the foodies.</p>

         Further, the DSF is not just about shopping. There would be in-mall fashion shows, street performers, musicians, jugglers and other entertainers. There will be live music performances, and magicians to keep up the excitement of the festival. DSF is entirely different from the other common shopping festivals.
         <br/>My personal suggestions for shopping:<br/> Global Village<br/> Mall of Emirates<br/> Outlet Village<br/> Meena Bazaar<br/> Dubai Mall<br/>
