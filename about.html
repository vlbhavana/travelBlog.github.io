                First of all, I’m not sure how you found me, but I’m a strong believer in everything happening for a reason. Ripples colliding to form a tidal wave of this very moment in time.<br>
                So however you found me in this internet world equipped with mediocre click-bait articles , I’m honored to have made the cut somewhere along the way.
                For those who don’t know me personally,  there’s still time to bail, I just want to welcome you into my world. I’m not your everyday travel blogger. <br>
                But with my colorful imagination, I want to take you guys on the adventure of a lifetime. How a girl who never desired to travel turned into a full-time nomad, finding a way to build a 6-figure blog to support a lifestyle that enables her to travel around the world, and getting paid to post about it.<br>
                I’m here to inspire others through my journey of being a solo female traveler, pushing the envelope of what’s possible, and creating the life of my dreams through a relentless pursuit and downright hustle.<br>
                There’s an unequivocal education to travel that I try to encourage others to learn about, and my mission and the ultimate goal is to make you, the reader, want to jump out of your seat and hop on the next flight out to anywhere.<br>
                <div style="padding:40px;margin:5px;background-image:url('quote.jpg');background-repeat: no-repeat;background-size: cover;width:40%;height:450px;margin-left: 300px;">
                </div>
                Whether you’re a fellow travel-lover or you’ve never taken a flight in your life, I have something for every one of you guys, and I want to continue sharing why travel is such an essential component to broadening our perspectives and creating a better world.<br>
                If you get one chance to live on this big, amazing planet your entire life, however long that may be, wouldn’t you want to spend time exploring it? Learning about it? Challenging it? Loving it? Yeah, me too.<br>
                I booked a one-way ticket to Dubai to my name after graduating college, and over 70+ countries across 6 continents later, I’m nowhere near finished!<br>
                So here’s to the new memories, the unspoken regrets, and the calculated risks of dancing down a road less traveled to expand my horizons and dare to find new ones. I bring you TRAVEL EXPRESS.
