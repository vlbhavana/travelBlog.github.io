        <p id="intro" style="margin:10">The most popular Dosa place, but here’s the catch! There are more than 4 hotels in Mysore by the same name!

            So which one’s the real deal? Well, there are two on Nazarbad main road in close proximity, and both of them are original. Turns out that Hotel Mylari was run by two brothers who later split up. So as long as the taste is the same I don’t mind barging in any of those two and you shouldn’t too. The Dosas here are very crispy yet soft, the chutney is almost like grated cotton but tastes very good. It’s not too spicy as the other places that follow.

            <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A very small hotel with limited seating you might want to reach early at 7am to try it!(Psst: There’s one more room on the first floor if you can manage to reach to backside of the building).<br/>
             If you have a big appetite,it’s easy to lose count of the number of<br/> Dosas you have!
             Also recommended here is the filter coffee to end your breakfast!
