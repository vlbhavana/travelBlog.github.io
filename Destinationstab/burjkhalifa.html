            The Burj Khalifa has not one but two stunning observatories. At The Top is located on the 124th and 125th floors and the premium At The Top Sky is on the 148th level – a staggering 555m above ground. Equally amazing views are available at At.Mosphere, one of the most coveted Burj Khalifa restaurants.
            Begin your experience in a high-speed elevator, with the skyward journey engrossing you in a multimedia experience. It will both captivate you and educate you on the creation of the Burj Khalifa and the history of Dubai. Once the doors open, you are welcomed by floor-to-ceiling glass and unobstructed 360-degree views of the world below. </p>

            At night, the view takes on a different meaning as you look out from the world's tallest skyscraper and see the vibrant cityscape. There are no time restraints whilst visiting At The Top, so take your time, relax and enjoy your momentous journey to embrace Dubai’s architecture and history.
            <br/>Insider Tip: Burj Khalifa is one of the most visited attractions in Dubai and normally experiences large queues. It is advised that you buy your tickets online and save about an hour of your time.
