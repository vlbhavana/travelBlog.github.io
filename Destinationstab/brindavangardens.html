            Located near the Krishnaraja Sagar Dam, on the outskirts of the city, the Brindavan Gardens have been modelled after the renowned Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir known for their Mughal design sensibilities. An endless expanse of green, dotted with colourful blooms, the terraced gardens are well laid, with neatly manicured lawns, trees, shrubs, flowerbeds, water chutes, and water channels. They are spread over an area of 60 acre, and admired for their symmetrical design. The highlight for visitors, however, is the famed musical fountain. A water ballet of sorts, with lights and music, is put up every evening for visitors to enjoy. Other places of interest at Brindavan gardens include the statue of Goddess Cauvery, children's park, fishery, pyramid fountain, inverted basket fountain, hydraulic research station and several others. There is something for everyone, and the sights, sounds and fragrances of the gardens are worth experiencing when you're in Mysuru. The credit for the creation of the gardens and their beautification goes to the then dewan of the princely state of Mysore, Sir Mirza Ismail. The gardens lie around 145 km from the state capital of Bengaluru.
