        <p id="intro" style="margin:10">The worldâ€™s tallest, most stunning, and well-choreographed fountain is a sight to marvel. A towering height that reaches 900 feet, the Dubai Fountain stands in the middle of the Burj Lake and attracts thousands of tourists every evening who flock here to experience Dubai nightlife and to watch the light and music spectacular show that the Dubai Fountain put up every evening.

            You will be astounded to find that the fountains have a unique structure that consists of five circles with a unique mechanism of nozzles that shoot water with a very high intensity. At this Dubai attraction, there are 6600 super lights and twenty-five colour projectors that give an illusion of more than a thousand expressions of water.

            The fountain performs on different songs and on different rhythms; from classical, contemporary, to Arabic and world music. While performing, the Dubai Fountain has as much as 22000 gallons of water in the air at any given moment.

            Spectators can also enjoy the show from every other neighbouring structure that overlooks the Burj Lake. Laser shows accompany the fountain dances in the evenings. The Dubai Fountains offer two amenities to allow the spectator to get closer to the fountain show. The Dubai Fountain Boardwalk is a wooden structure built on the Burj Lake.

The spectators get to view the show from as near as 9 metres.  Apart from that, the Dubai Fountain Lake Ride allows spectators to enjoy the show from traditional Abra boats on the Burj Lake. Tickets for both facilities must be booked in advance. Shows are held daily, with a minimum of one show per day, and does not charge a fee to be witnessed.
