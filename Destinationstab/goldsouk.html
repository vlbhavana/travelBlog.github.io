        <p id="intro" style="margin:10">Souk shopping in the city of gold isn’t complete without a visit to Dubai's famous Gold Souk.
             Enter this labyrinth of gold, silver and precious gemstones to buy the perfect gift for yourself, or a loved one. 
             Always remember to purchase your souvenirs directly from stores within the souk, and not from street vendors that may pop up nearby. 
             Every jewellery store at the Gold Souk has to adhere to strict government regulations, guaranteeing quality and fair prices to all.
             There's more demand than ever for gold jewellery of lesser weight. Delicate chains and slimmed down bracelets are replacing heavier rings and thick bangles, which gives customers a chance to select a design that won’t break the bank.
             For daily wear, sculpted designs take first-prize using thin, intricate carvings that are eye-catching without being too ostentatious. For example, Dubai-based jewellery brand Damas has struck gold with with its range of nature-inspired Italian designs, while India's Joyalukkas delights with bangles and necklaces reminiscent of architecture, such as geometrically-cut windows. With fewer engravings, Italian brand Damiani employs thin chains and simplified sculpting – the snake a popular motif – for everyday fashion.

             The Gold Souk is one place where you must haggle. If you see something you like, it will be weighed in front of you, and the starting price quoted to you. This is where the haggling begins. It is not just gold that you can haggle over. You should also dispute the initial price quoted to you on any jewelry item.
             

As well as the Gold Souk, you might like to visit the Gold and Diamond Park or the Souk Dubai Mall. These are also places where haggling is acceptable.

In addition to gold and gems, it is not inappropriate to attempt a little gentle haggling in watch shops, even high-end watch shops. The haggling process in these shops follows a different trajectory as the shop assistant does not always have the power to make the decision you want, but what he or she can do is telephone the brand manager to see if any movement is possible on the price. But, as I say, be gentle as discounting prices in these stores is not the norm; it is discouraged.
