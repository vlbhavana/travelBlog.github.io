            The Lalitha Mahal Palace is located at the foot of the Chamundi Hill, Mysore, Karnataka. Though built as a palace, it was taken over by the Ashok Group of the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) and is now an opulent heritage hotel.
            The two-storied structure mirrors the styles of English manor houses and Italian Palazzos with a projecting porch. It is, specifically, an adaptation of St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral, London. Ionic double columns support the structure of the palace. There are spherical domes with a dominating central dome above the entrance hall.

The palace was built with an ornate entry called the guard house. In addition, the palace has a banquet hall, a dancing floor, a curving and imposing Italian marble staircase and an elegantly fashioned viceroy room. The palace also boasts of Italian marble floors, Belgian crystal chandeliers, beautiful cut glass lamps, opulent furniture, and elegant Persian carpets.

            <br/><br/><br/>With its conversion to a heritage hotel in 1974, many modern amenities have been added to the traditional ones. There is a swimming pool; and the dancing and banquet rooms have been converted to conference rooms and dining rooms preserving the old-world grandeur. The white colour of the exterior of the palace has been maintained, while the sprawling terrace and ornamental gardens have been retained.
