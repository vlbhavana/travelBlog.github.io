            According to Kumar, one of the partners of Guru Sweets, the Mysore Pak was first prepared by his great grandfather Kakasura Madappa. According to him this sweet was prepared when Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV was the king of the erstwhile Mysore. Kakasura Madappa was the chief chef of the Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV and was known for preparing the sweets.
            
            Once he prepared a special sweet by using the ghee, gram flour and sugar. Kakasura Madappa didn’t name the sweet he had prepared. It was Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV who named it as the Royal Sweet Mysore Pak. Like everything else, the history of Mysore Pak also involves an accidental discovery.

            <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“According to our forefathers, my great grandfather was asked to prepare various sweets for the guests. While preparing other sweets he tried a new combination which eventually becomes royal sweet,” said Kumar and his brother Shivanand.

            The king loved the sweet so much so that he wanted the public to get a taste of this royal delicacy and hence asked Madappa to open a sweet shop outside the premises of the place. This could be the <br/>beginning of Guru Sweets as well.
